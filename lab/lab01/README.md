# Starter Code for Lab 1

The starter code for Lab 1 has demo code for both the MCU and FPGA.
The FPGA generates a signal to toggle an LED on and off.
Then the MCU reads in this toggling signal and echos it back to the FPGA.
Both LEDs should toggle together in sync if the FPGA and MCU are talking to each other properly.
